# tipCalculator
A tip calculator based on JavaScript generates tip based on three inputs 
(i) the total amount of bill. 
(ii) the number of people sharing bill to divide equal amount of tip. 
(iii) and last the service quality.

And yeah this is not responsive so if on mobile use chrome and view on desktop site.
